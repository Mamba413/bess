#' @name gravier
#'
#' @description Gravier et al. (2010) have considered small, invasive ductal carcinomas
#' without axillary lymph node involvement (T1T2N0) to predict metastasis of
#' small node-negative breast carcinoma. Using comparative genomic
#' hybridization arrays, they examined 168 patients over a five-year period.
#' The 111 patients with no event after diagnosis were labelled good, and the
#' 57 patients with early metastasis were labelled poor.

#' Factors associated with prostate specific antigen
#'
#' @name prostate
#'
#' @description Data from a study by by Stamey et al. (1989) to examine the association
#' between prostate specific antigen (PSA) and several clinical measures that
#' are potentially associated with PSA in men who were about to receive a
#' radical prostatectomy.  The variables are as follows:
#'
#' \itemize{ \item lcavol: Log cancer volume \item lweight: Log prostate weight
#' \item age: The man's age \item lbph: Log of the amount of benign hyperplasia
#' \item svi: Seminal vesicle invasion; 1=Yes, 0=No \item lcp: Log of capsular
#' penetration \item gleason: Gleason score \item pgg45: Percent of Gleason
#' scores 4 or 5 \item lpsa: Log PSA }
